/**
 * FUNCTON:
 * - strdup()
 * - gnl()
 * 
 * @param
 * STATIC CHAR buffer[BUFFER_SIZE] : 
 * - Static buffer to store chunks of data read from a file descriptor (fd)
 * - The read system call fills this buffer with up to BUFFER_SIZE bytes from the file at a time.
 * - The read function doesnâ€™t always read the entire content of the file at once (especially for large files). 
 *   So, this buffer holds the portion of the file currently being processed until the function needs more data.
 * 
 * CHAR line[7000] : 
 * - This egular (non-static) array is used to store the line currently being read. 
 * - The function copies characters from buffer into line until it finds a newline (\n) or reaches the end of the buffer.
 * - Why 70000: The large size ensures that even very long lines can be stored without running out of space.
 * 
 * STATIC INT buffer_read : Static variable to keep track of how many bytes were read into the buffer
 * STATIC INT buffer_pos : Static variable to track the current position in the buffer
 * INT i;
